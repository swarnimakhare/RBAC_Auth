# RBAC_Auth
A Role-Based Control Authentication System (RBAC) is a secure framework for managing user access based on roles (e.g., admin, manager, users). It ensures users can only access features or resources allowed by their assigned roles, improving security and scalability. This system typically includes user authentication, dynamic role assignment, and access control mechanisms using technologies like JWT. Ideal for applications requiring fine-grained permission management.We can monitor the failed logins attempt in the mongoDB compass which are locked after certain failed attempts.
